# Overview
This is the Climate Change project using PySpark. 


In a remote part of the world, hidden somewhere in Tasmania, researchers of climate change decided to place a steel vault about the size of a school bus. It will operate
much like a plane’s black box, and its mission will be to inform whoever discovers it about the end of human civilization. In other words, it will serve as a guide for a post
apocalyptic society. It will create an archive for the future habitats of earth that could be critical in forming their society by piecing together the missteps of humanity, should
humanity be destroyed by climate change. The box will record leaders’ actions (or inactions) by scraping the internet for keywords relating to climate change from
newspapers, social media and peer-reviewed journals. It will collect daily metrics, including average oceanic and land temperatures, atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration and biodiversity loss.

In this project, we will assume that we are the future species of earth that discovered the Tasmanian box, but we will simplify the analysis to just two datasets, which are temperature
data and CO2 Emissions data.
